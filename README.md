*A modular, fast and open Deep Learning Framework for distributed
state of the art Deep Learning on both {C, G}PUs*

For more information see the [Documentation][documentation].

[documentation]: http://autumnai.github.io/leaf

## Getting Started

> Disclaimer: Leaf is currently in a very early and heavy stage of development.
> If you are experiencing any bugs that are not due to not yet implemented features,
> feel free to create a issue.

If you're using Cargo, just add Leaf to your Cargo.toml:

    [dependencies]
    leaf = "0.0.1"

If you're using [Cargo Edit][cargo-edit], you can
call:

    $ cargo add leaf


You can find examples at [Leaf Examples][leaf-examples].
Leaf Examples provides a CLI, so you can run popular Deep Learning examples with
Leaf right from the command line.

## Leaf Ecosystem and Extensions

We design Leaf and all other crates for machine learning completely modular and
as extensible as possible. More helpful crates you can use with Leaf:

- [**Cuticula**][cuticula]: Preprocessing Framework for Machine Learning
- [**Phloem**][phloem]: Universal CPU/GPU Data Blob for Machine Learning
