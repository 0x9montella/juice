collenchyma-NN provides full BLAS support for [Collenchyma][collenchyma],
so you can use Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms on servers, desktops or mobiles,
GPUs, FPGAs or CPUS, without carrying about OpenCL or CUDA support on the
machine.

collenchyma-NN was started at [Autumn][autumn] for the Rust Machine Intelligence
Framework [Leaf][leaf].
